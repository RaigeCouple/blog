        <h2>Big News On the Horizon</h2>
        <p class="date">June 29, 2025</p>
        <p>
          We've got something exciting cooking behind the scenes! While we’re still in the approval process, we couldn’t help but share a little teaser. Soon, we’ll have something really fun to celebrate. This next chapter is going to be a good one!

        <h2>Marching with Love</h2>
        <p class="date">June 19, 2025</p>
        <p>
          After meeting up with friends and rallying together, we made our way down to the courthouse to march in solidarity. The crowd was huge, signs were bold, and we had our pup along for the adventure. Moments like this are why we show up and why we document it all.

        <p class="date">June 18, 2024</p>
        <p>
          Sun blazing, flags waving — we joined the Pride celebration downtown. Everyone was smiling, singing, and showing up with love. We snapped this photo mid-march, soaking in the joy, the heat, and the powerful sense of unity that filled the streets.

        <h2>Jack White Live</h2>
        <p class="date">July 20, 2024</p>
        <p>
          We decided to grab some last second tickets and head down to Edgefield and see Jack White. The night was amazing and was most definitly a highlight to summer. Jack shreded like none other and the crowd loved it. Even landed ourselves front row parking.

        <h2>Market Lights & Music</h2>
        <p class="date">July 8, 2023</p>
        <p>
          One of our favorite summer nights! We explored a local outdoor market filled with string lights, food stalls, and the buzz of live music. We danced a little, laughed a lot, and grabbed this photo near the tree-lined path before grabbing drinks and people-watching until dusk.

        <h2>Golden Hour</h2>
        <p class="date">July 23, 2023</p>
        <p>
          A spontaneous weekend trip brought us to the coast right in time for golden hour. As the sun set behind the clouds, we grabbed this photo in the dunes. The cool breeze, salty air, and quiet waves set the perfect tone for a cozy evening of hoodie cuddles and watching the stars come out.

        <h2>A Pup & The Beach</h2>
        <p class="date">June 4, 2023</p>
        <p>
          We packed up early and made our way to Longbeach with coffee in hand and our pup excitedly riding shotgun. The beach welcomed us with a gentle breeze and open sky. We spent the day playing fetch, wandering barefoot through the sand, and just soaking up each other. Nothing beats that ocean air and the happiness of a sandy-snouted dog.
